# mydiff

This is the very first exercise and is meant to learn the basics of the C language.

You have to implement a custom `diff` command which outputs the number of differences
for each line of the two files provided.

USAGE: `mydiff [-i] file1 file2`

The option `-i` enables case insensitive comparison.

In order to execute this program run `make` inside the project folder and call
mydiff locally with `./mydiff [-i] file1 file2`.

If you want to read the docs, open `index.html` which is located in the html
directory.

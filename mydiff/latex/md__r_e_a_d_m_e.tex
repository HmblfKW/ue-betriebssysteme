This is the very first exercise and is meant to learn the basics of the C language.

You have to implement a custom {\ttfamily diff} command which outputs the number of differences for each line of the two files provided.

U\+S\+A\+GE\+: {\ttfamily mydiff \mbox{[}-\/i\mbox{]} file1 file2}

The option {\ttfamily -\/i} enables case insensitive comparison.

In order to execute this program run {\ttfamily make} inside the project folder and call mydiff locally with {\ttfamily ./mydiff \mbox{[}-\/i\mbox{]} file1 file2}.

If you want to read the docs, open {\ttfamily index.\+html} which is located in the html directory.
